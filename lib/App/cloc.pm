=head1 NAME

App::cloc - Count Lines of Code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CPAN packaging of the famous L<CLOC|http://cloc.sourceforge.net/> utility, as agreed with its author Al Danial.

Contains L<cloc> version C<1.62>.

=head1 CREATION

I just downloaded the L<tarball|http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloc/files/cloc/v1.62/cloc-1.62.tar.gz/download> and concatenated the cloc.pl and the cloc.pod.
Other than that it is a common (almost empty ... yes I am lazy too :) CPAN package.

All credits go to Al Danial.
